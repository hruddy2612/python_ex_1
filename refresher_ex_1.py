# Python refresher exercises
# part 1 
# May 25, 2020

# - This set of exercises uses topics from refreshers 1 and 2: basic data types and flow control
# - But, you're free to use other python concepts (functions, OOP) as well
# - My solution is directly below, but with a visual buffer so you don't see it accidentally.

# You should have gotten this file by forking the python_ex_1 project from my github
# repo: https://github.com/ChHarding/python_ex_1

# How to work the exercises:
# - Use a debugger to set a break point at the print() at the top of the solution part so you
#  don't accidentally run beyond it and see the solution. This is the "end" breakpoint
# - Set another "start" breakpoint at the print() that shows the start of each part
#  write you code between those break points
# - To run your code, start the debugger (will stop at the "start" breakpoint) and
#  hit step or continue. Once you have your bug free solution, remove the start and
#  end breakpoints and move on to the next part. Here's an example:



# part 0
# This is just a simple example to demonstrate how the start and end
# breakpoint system works
# Task: create a variable with your name and print out Hello <name>
print("start of part 0") # set breakpoint here
# your code here 
name = "Heather"
print("Hello",  name)


print("end of 0") # set breakpoint here

# solution 1
name = "Chris"
print("Hello", name)
'''

# Before we really start, a couple more things:
# - your solution may be different or even better than what I showed
# - Please get in the habit of documenting your code as you go along
#   You don't need to state the obvious but you should point out anything 
#   that could be interesting later.
# - After you've finished the code for a part (or even more often) you must
#   perform a commit! You should also push your commit to the remote master (Push)
#   once in a while

# Grading:
# - I will grade purely on effort based on your comments and commits!
# - Each part is worth 1 point
# - That means I don't really grade (judge you) by the quality of your code
# - Please give it your best shot and try to get a good result but it's up to you
#   you fancy you want to get. If you're stuck, you can't get a good result,
#   and you're out of time, just put in a (brief) comment about what you tried
#   and move on. If a part always produces an error (i.e. would stop execution)
#   use ''' ''' to comment out the entire part, that way your debugger won't stop!
#   I will still give you your point if I can see that you at least tried ... something!

# Handing in:
# - once you're done type this into your OS console in VS:
# python refresher_ex_1.py > results.txt
# this will run your file and put the output into results.txt.
# on Canvas hand in:
# - your version of this .py file
# - your results.txt
# - tell me the URL of your forked repo 






# part 1
# task:  L = [0, [], [1,2,3,4], [[5],[6,7]], [8,9,10]]
# using both, indexing and slicing on L, assemble and print a new list N that contains:
# [0,2,3,[5,6],8,10] 
# as an example, here's  how i've constructed a similar list X which contains [[2, 3], [10]] from L:
#
# L = [0, [], [1,2,3,4], [[5],[6,7]], [8,9,10]]
# X = [ L[2][1:-1], L[-1][2] ] 
# print(X)  => [[2, 3], [10]]
# You need to do something similar but end up with [0,2,3,[5,6],8,10] instead. One way to work 
# through this is to break the process down in small steps, store result of each step in a new variable
# and use these variables to assemble the final result.
